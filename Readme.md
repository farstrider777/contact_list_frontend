###Built contact list app in angular hooked it up to backend I deployed on Heroku. Afterwards modified app to serve as a readout to a second project Spendo###

Skills practiced

1. Angular
  * Wrote html with embedded angular variables.
  * Used two way data-binding, to allow immediate updates to orginal app.
  * Connected to a back end I created. Used Http requests for Posting, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data.
  * Modified original app to serve as a readout for a wholly original product Spendo.
